Insilicut - in silico cutting of genomic DNA with restriction enzyme
====================================================================

This directory contains insilicut, a minimal package reporting fragments when
cutting in silico genomic DNA with a restriction enzyme. It is potentially 
useful when planning a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) experiment (also known 
as restriction-assisted DNA sequencing, RAD-seq).

Insilicut is free software, you can redistribute it and/or modify it under

Installation
============

Insilicut doesn't need any compilation as it only contains scripts. However, 
it still has a few requirements:
* Bash and Awk;
* PaTMaN (https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/patman/);
* Python (version >= 2.7 or 3.1);
* R (optional, version >= 2.15).

First, download the package, for instance:
       wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/timflutre/insilicut/archive/master.zip
       unzip master; rm -f master; cd insilicut-master

Then, run the tests:
     make check

Finally, to install the package in ~/bin, simply type:
	make install

You can also specify another directory, for instance:
	make install INSTALLDIR="~/tmp"
